## This is a basic example showing the usage of FlxSVGSprite

It showcases basic instantiation, movement and rotation of the sprites, as well as the ability to change the sprites svg graphic with the `loadSVGGraphic` method (press SPACE on the demo to shuffle the graphics of each sprite).

### Setup
- Make sure you have [this](https://github.com/UncertainProd/svg) fork of svg installed using the `haxelib git` command (refer instructions at the root of this repo) and that you have `flxsvgsprite` installed.
- Run `lime test <html5|windows|linux|...>` depending on the target you want to compile for.
